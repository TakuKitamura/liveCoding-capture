## ### Simple Commands
##
## Simple commands consist of one or more words separated by blanks. The first
## word is the name of the command to be executed; any remaining words are
## passed as arguments to the command. For example,
##
##     ls -l
##

mkdir /tmp/simple-commands
cd /tmp/simple-commands
touch 1 2 3
ls -l | awk '{ print $9 }'
rm 1 2 3
cd $_origin_
rmdir /tmp/simple-commands

#-     
#-     1
#-     2
#-     3

## is a command that prints a list of files in the current directory. The
## argument `-l` tells `ls` to print status information, the size and the
## creation date for each file.
##
## Multiple commands may be written on the same line separated by a semicolon.
